    <p>A minimum of three sections was requested.  You can find them below*, in my footer:<br>

        <p>My favorite philosopher (out of one, I am woefully underread).  Take a look at his Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig">here.</a></p>
        <li>What does he do?</li>
        <p>Read the Wikipedia page.  I am tired of typing into an overly-helpful text editor that tries to turn
            my every word into a <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipl-rLRxOrs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            ...variable.  I was going for variable.  But video works too...<br><br>
            He also wrote the word On Guard, an introduction to Christian apologetics.  Click on the book. I've made it a link.<br>

        <li>Why do you like him so much?</li>
        <p>Logic is &gt than feeling.  (did you catch the html entity there?)  Only one is immutable and certain.
            
            I've always loved thinking and arguing.  <br><br>
            I was born into a nominally Catholic family, and loved being Catholic. <br><br>

            When I was twelve I was argued out of Catholicism and into Protestantism.<br><br>

            When I was thirteen I argued myself out of Christianity and into atheism.<br><br>

            At sixteen I was argued into Mormonism.<br><br>

            At twenty I was argued out of Mormonism and back into Christianity again.<br><br>
            <img src="http://www.ldssmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Mormon-LDS-Meme-Funny-1.png"><br><br>
            At twenty-four I was argued back into Catholicism. <br> <br>

            And I am reasonably convinced that I will stay Catholic until I die.<br><br>

        I've always figured that it's safer to follow my head than my heart.  Logic shows us truth, and the truth won't change.
        Feelings always will.

            <h6>While I don't usually do the minimum required, at the moment I am much more concerned with 
                    prepping my Pre-Calc class for tomorrow, or preparing for open house at school, or baking for my husband, 
                    or finally delving into those Data Science videos I've been meaning to watch than I am in typing an overly 
                    verbose webpage.  I am not being lazy, I am managing my time and responsibilities efficiently.  And I fully intend
                    on deleting every last trace of this monstrosity before applying for jobs.
