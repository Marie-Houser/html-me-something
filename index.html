    <li>Who is William Lane Craig?</li>
            <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JSJt7EA0qCQ/VdnPuCJUlVI/AAAAAAAADks/InyQgFPLJfA/s640/william-lane-craig-law-debate-thinking.jpg">
            <p>My favorite philosopher (out of one, I am woefully underread).  Take a look at his Wikipedia page 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lane_Craig">here.</a>  He's a protestant, which
                means that he is confused about what "traditions of men" means, but other than that he's pretty solid.</p>
    <li>What does he do?</li>
            <p>He applies philosophy to the explanation of Christianity to those who don't understand it.  He debates professionally
                with atheists, and always wins.  It's never even close.  If you can stomach some truly puerile behavior on the part of 
                Dr. Krauss, check out their debate below:

                He also wrote the book On Guard, an introduction to Christian apologetics.  Click on the book. I've made it a link.<br>

            </a></p>
    <li>Why do you like him so much?</li></ol>
        <p>Logic is &gt than feeling.  (did you catch the html entity there?)  Only one is immutable and certain.
            
            I've always loved thinking and arguing.  
            <p class="biography">I was born into a nominally Catholic family, and loved being Catholic.

            When I was twelve I was argued out of Catholicism and into Protestantism.

            When I was thirteen I argued myself out of Christianity and into atheism.

            At sixteen I was argued into Mormonism.

            At twenty I was argued out of Mormonism and back into Christianity again.

            At twenty-four I was argued back into Catholicism.

            And I am reasonably convinced that I will stay Catholic until I die.

            I've always figured that it's safer to follow my head than my heart.  Logic shows us truth, and the truth won't change.
        Feelings always will.

            <h6>*While I don't usually do the minimum required, at the moment I am much more concerned with 
                    prepping my Pre-Calc class for tomorrow, or finally delving into those Data Science videos I've been meaning
                     to watch than I am in typing an overly verbose webpage.  I am not being lazy, I am managing my time 
                     and responsibilities efficiently.  And I fully intend on deleting every last trace of this monstrosity before 
                     applying for jobs.
